# Hello!

> I want to be honest with you, with user who somehow has found out about my GH.
> 
> It is my personal page, not formal CV for recruiters or big corporates. You won't find literally any important information about me here (except my experience and project), so...
> 
> Let's rather discuss together about collaboration, if you are interested in me and my skills, but feel free to explore my GitHub and my experience.
---
> *Code is creativity, until it works. Hence, use AI cautiously as me or it breaks your entire codebase :)*
---
> Yes, I am pretty straightforward, but really kind too >.<
---
> There is my main stack, by the way. However, I am ready to learn something new!
